3. **ChatGPT**: To create a dog animation with CSS and HTML, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a new HTML file and create a div that will contain the dog image:
```
<div id="dog">
  <img src="dog.png" alt="dog">
</div>
```
2. Style the dog div with CSS:
```
#dog {
  position: relative;
  animation: dogmove 1s infinite linear;
}
```
3. Create an animation for the dog using CSS keyframes:
```
@keyframes dogmove {
  0% {
    left: 0;
  }
  100% {
    left: 100%;
  }
}
```
4. Add any additional styles you want for the dog (such as size, position, or color).

Here is an example CSS and HTML code for a dog animation:

HTML:
```
<div id="dog">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lJmC8bF.png" alt="dog">
</div>
```
CSS:
```
#dog {
  position: relative;
  animation: dogmove 1s infinite linear;
}

@keyframes dogmove {
  0% {
    left: 0;
  }
  100% {
    left: 100%;
  }
}

img {
  width: 100px;
}
```
This code will move the dog image from left to right across the screen. You can customize the animation further by adjusting the animation duration, the keyframe percentages, and the dog images used.
